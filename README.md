## Requirements

- [Sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) >= 10.0
- [Acorn](https://github.com/roots/acorn) >= 3.0
- [ACF Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) >= 5.8.0

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
$ composer require log1x/acf-composer
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

Start by publishing the `config/acf.php` configuration file using Acorn:

```bash
$ wp acorn vendor:publish --tag="acf-composer"
```

### Generating a Field Group

To create your first field group, start by running the following generator command from your theme directory:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:field ExampleField
```

This will create `src/Fields/ExampleField.php` which is where you will create and manage your first field group.

Taking a glance at the generated `ExampleField.php` stub, you will notice that it has a simple list configured.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Fields;

use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Field;

class ExampleField extends Field
{
    /**
     * The field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('example_field');

        $fields
            ->setLocation('post_type', '==', 'post');

        $fields
            ->addRepeater('items')
                ->addText('item')
            ->endRepeater();

        return $fields->build();
    }
}
```

Proceed by checking the `Add Post` for the field to ensure things are working as intended – and then [get to work](https://github.com/Log1x/acf-builder-cheatsheet).

### Generating a Field Partial

A field partial consists of a field group that can be re-used and/or added to existing field groups.

To start, let's generate a partial called _ListItems_ that we can use in the _Example_ field we generated above.

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:partial ListItems
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Fields\Partials;

use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Partial;

class ListItems extends Partial
{
    /**
     * The partial field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('listItems');

        $fields
            ->addRepeater('items')
                ->addText('item')
            ->endRepeater();

        return $fields;
    }
}
```

Looking at `ListItems.php`, you will see out of the box it consists of an identical list repeater as seen in your generated field.

A key difference to note compared to an ordinary field is the omitting of `->build()` instead returning the `FieldsBuilder` instance itself.

This can be utilized in our _Example_ field by passing the `::class` constant to `->addPartial()`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Fields;

use App\Fields\Partials\ListItems;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Field;

class Example extends Field
{
    /**
     * The field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('example');

        $fields
            ->setLocation('post_type', '==', 'post');

        $fields
            ->addPartial(ListItems::class);

        return $fields->build();
    }
}
```

### Generating a Block

Generating a block is generally the same as generating a field as seen above.

Start by creating the block field using Acorn:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:block ExampleBlock
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Blocks;

use Log1x\AcfComposer\Block;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;

class ExampleBlock extends Block
{
    /**
     * The block name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $name = 'Example Block';

    /**
     * The block description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $description = 'Lorem ipsum...';

    /**
     * The block category.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $category = 'common';

    /**
     * The block icon.
     *
     * @var string|array
     */
    public $icon = 'star-half';

    /**
     * Data to be passed to the block before rendering.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function with()
    {
        return [
            'items' => $this->items(),
        ];
    }

    /**
     * The block field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('example_block');

        $fields
            ->addRepeater('items')
                ->addText('item')
            ->endRepeater();

        return $fields->build();
    }

    /**
     * Return the items field.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function items()
    {
        return get_field('items') ?: [];
    }
}
```

You may also pass `--construct` to the command above to generate a stub with the block properties set within an `attributes` method. This can be useful for localization, etc.

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:block Example --construct
```

When running the block generator, one difference to a generic field is an accompanied `View` is generated in the `resources/views/blocks` directory.

```php
@if ($items)
  <ul>
    @foreach ($items as $item)
      <li>{{ $item['item'] }}</li>
    @endforeach
  </ul>
@else
  <p>No items found!</p>
@endif

<div>
  <InnerBlocks />
</div>
```

Like the field generator, the example block contains a simple list repeater and is working out of the box.

#### Block Preview View

While `$block->preview` is an option for conditionally modifying your block when shown in the editor, you may also render your block using a seperate view.

Simply duplicate your existing view prefixing it with `preview-` (e.g. `preview-example.blade.php`).

### Generating a Widget

> [!IMPORTANT]
> With WordPress 5.8, Blocks can now be used as widgets making this feature somewhat deprecated as you would just make a block instead.
>
> If you are on the latest WordPress and would like to use the classic widget functionality from ACF Composer, you will need to [opt-out of the widget block editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/opting-out/).

Creating a sidebar widget using ACF Composer is extremely easy. Widgets are automatically loaded and rendered with Blade, as well as registered with `WP_Widget` which is usually rather annoying.

Start by creating a widget using Acorn:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:widget ExampleWidget
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Widgets;

use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Widget;

class ExampleWidget extends Widget
{
    /**
     * The widget name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $name = 'Example Widget';

    /**
     * The widget description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $description = 'Lorem ipsum...';

    /**
     * Data to be passed to the widget before rendering.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function with()
    {
        return [
            'items' => $this->items(),
        ];
    }

    /**
     * The widget title.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function title() {
        return get_field('title', $this->widget->id);
    }

    /**
     * The widget field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('example_widget');

        $fields
            ->addText('title');

        $fields
            ->addRepeater('items')
                ->addText('item')
            ->endRepeater();

        return $fields->build();
    }

    /**
     * Return the items field.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function items()
    {
        return get_field('items', $this->widget->id) ?: [];
    }
}
```

Similar to blocks, widgets are also accompanied by a view generated in `resources/views/widgets`.

```php
@if ($items)
  <ul>
    @foreach ($items as $item)
      <li>{{ $item['item'] }}</li>
    @endforeach
  </ul>
@else
  <p>No items found!</p>
@endif
```

Out of the box, the Example widget is ready to go and should appear in the backend.

### Generating an Options Page

Creating an options page is similar to creating a regular field group in additional to a few configuration options available to customize the page (most of which, are optional.)

Start by creating an option page using Acorn:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:options ExampleOptions
```

```php
<?php

namespace App\Options;

use Log1x\AcfComposer\Builder;
use Log1x\AcfComposer\Options as Field;

class ExampleOptions extends Field
{
    /**
     * The option page menu name.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $name = 'Example Options';

    /**
     * The option page document title.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $title = 'Example Options | Options';

    /**
     * The option page field group.
     *
     * @return array
     */
    public function fields()
    {
        $fields = Builder::make('example_options');

        $fields
            ->addRepeater('items')
                ->addText('item')
            ->endRepeater();

        return $fields->build();
    }
}
```

Optionally, you may pass `--full` to the command above to generate a stub that contains additional configuration examples.

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:options Options --full
```

Once finished, you should see an Options page appear in the backend.

All fields registered will have their location automatically set to this page.

## Caching Blocks & Fields

As of v3, ACF Composer now has the ability to cache registered blocks to native `block.json` files and field groups to a flat file JSON manifest automatically using CLI.

This can lead to a **dramatic increase** in performance in projects both small and large, especially when loading a post in the editor containing multiple custom blocks.

> [!NOTE]
> Making changes to blocks or fields once cached will not take effect until cleared or re-cached.

The best time to do this is during deployment and can be done using the `acf:cache` command:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:cache [--status]
```

Cache can then be cleared using the `acf:clear` command:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:clear
```

The ACF Composer cache status can be found using `--status` on `acf:cache` as seen above or by running `wp acorn about`.

## Custom Stub Generation

To customize the stubs generated by ACF Composer, you can easily publish the `stubs` directory using Acorn:

```bash
$ wp acorn acf:stubs
```

The publish command generates all available stubs by default. However, each stub file is optional. When a stub file doesn't exist in the `stubs/acf-composer` directory, the default stub provided by the package will be used.

## Default Field Settings

A useful feature unique to ACF Composer is the ability to set field type as well as field group defaults. Any globally set default can of course be over-ridden by simply setting it on the individual field.

### Global

Taking a look at `config/acf.php`, you will see a few pre-configured defaults:

```php
'defaults' => [
    'trueFalse' => ['ui' => 1],
    'select' => ['ui' => 1],
],
```

When setting `trueFalse` and `select` to have their `ui` set to `1` by default, it is no longer necessary to repeatedly set `'ui' => 1` on your fields. This takes effect globally and can be overridden by simply setting a different value on a field.

### Field Group

It is also possible to define defaults on individual field groups. This is done by simply defining `$defaults` in your field class.

```php
/**
 * Default field type settings.
 *
 * @return array
 */
protected $defaults = ['ui' => 0];
```

### My Defaults

Here are a couple defaults I personally use. Any prefixed with `acfe_` are related to [ACF Extended](https://www.acf-extended.com/).

```php
'defaults' => [
    'fieldGroup' => ['instruction_placement' => 'acfe_instructions_tooltip'],
    'repeater' => ['layout' => 'block', 'acfe_repeater_stylised_button' => 1],
    'trueFalse' => ['ui' => 1],
    'select' => ['ui' => 1],
    'postObject' => ['ui' => 1, 'return_format' => 'object'],
    'accordion' => ['multi_expand' => 1],
    'group' => ['layout' => 'table', 'acfe_group_modal' => 1],
    'tab' => ['placement' => 'left'],
    'sidebar_selector' => ['default_value' => 'sidebar-primary', 'allow_null' => 1]
],
```
